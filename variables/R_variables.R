#Variables are containers for storing the data values.
#Variable are used to allocate a memory location to a specific
#value that we want to store.
#A variable must start with a letter.
#It can contain underscore,letters and numbers.
#It cannot contain - and all other special characters,

#mostly <- operator is preffered over =.

#2.Float
#3.String/character
#4.Logical/Boolean
